“Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine
system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances from a pool 
and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potentialto improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by Committee (Seung 
et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller,
2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has
knowledge of the class labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to
achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as reaching a stage 
where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).”

Visually, it may seem like the land is suitable for building however personal judgement is not always reliable for these scenarios. Personal judgement does not consider 
details such as ground water levels, which is crucial to earthquake prone countries like Japan. All soils have a minimum limit of magnitude for of soil liquefaction to
occur. There are soil treatment methods which’ll improves the soil quality to ensure land is suitable for construction. It’s said that on an earthquake with as small as 
magnitude as 4.5 can cause liquefaction but only for land that’s not even suitable for the lightest of buildings. Furthermore, for land suitable for building structures, 
a minimal magnitude of 5 can cause liquefaction. Therefore for countries effected by larger magnitudes, they use soil treatment methods to ensure the soil can resist 
higher magnitudes.
