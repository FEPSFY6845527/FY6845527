Modern knowledge and technology enable us to create new buildings which are no longer prone to earthquakes which is important in earthquake prone areas such as Japan and 
Chile. This technological advancement prevents humanitarian and economic casualties if done correctly. As it’ll mitigate injuries and lives lost from collapsing buildings 
and will also prevent the government doing constant maintenance due to this phenomenon. This conference project will discuss what soil liquefaction is and the treatment used
on the soils to mitigate its effects on structures. Soil liquefaction is considered one of the most challenging natural hazards for Civil Engineers.

Visually, it may seem like the land is suitable for building however personal judgement is not always reliable for these scenarios. Personal judgement does not consider 
details such as ground water levels, which is crucial to earthquake prone countries like Japan. All soils have a minimum limit of magnitude for of soil liquefaction to 
occur, known as the liquefaction potential

<a href="#Kramer et al., 2008">(Kramer et al., 2008)</a>

There are soil treatment methods which’ll improves the soil quality to ensure land is suitable for 
construction. It’s said that on an earthquake with as small as magnitude as 4.5 can cause liquefaction but only for land that’s not even suitable for the lightest of 
buildings 

<a href="#Green & Bommer, 2019">(Green & Bommer, 2019).</a>

Furthermore, for land suitable for building structures, a minimal magnitude of 5 can cause liquefaction 
<a href="#Green & Bommer, 2019">(Green & Bommer, 2019).</a>

Therefore, for countries effected by larger magnitudes, they use soil treatment methods to increase its liquefaction potential.

Before searching around for solutions, it’s important to understand what soil liquefaction is and why it happens. Soil liquefaction is the process where soil temporarily 
loses it strength and stops its ability to support buildings
  
<a href="#Kramer et al., 2008">(Kramer et al., 2008)</a>
Soil liquidation usually occur to water saturated soil. During the phenomenon of
earthquakes, the space between the water between soil particles exerts pressure which causes the soil particles to spread out, hence lowering its density.

<a href="#Rafferty, 2011">(Rafferty, 2011)</a> 
Once a building is affected by soil liquefaction it is difficult to near impossible to fix the scenario due to its mass. So, it’s important to come up
with a solution before an earthquake hits.

Vibroflotation is a method a soil treatment. It’s a ground improvement technique which enhances the soil quality by densifying loose granular soils.
<a href="#Wang et al., 2022">(Wang et al., 2022)</a> 
"The process involves a probe and as its lowered down into the soil, it’ll generate vibrations which reorganised the soil particle’s structure and makes them more compact together."
<a href="#Wang et al., 2022">(Wang et al., 2022)</a>  
Hence increasing its density allowing it to both support heavy structures and less prone to soil liquefaction. Other instances to further minimise the risk of soil liquefaction, 
they add additional settlement like gravel creating stone columns. Stone columns increases the maximum capacity which land can hold a building.  
<a href="#Triantafyllidis & kimmig, 2019">(Triantafyllidis & kimmig, 2019)</a>

</figure>

<p>
Furthermore, the stone column acts as a water pressure evacuation point and mitigates further risks of soil liquefaction in case an earthquake hit.
  <a href="#Triantafyllidis & kimmig, 2019">(Triantafyllidis & kimmig, 2019)</a>
However, this process 
does also have its drawbacks. For regular housing, vibroflotation is too expensive for a regular household. It is only suitable for large scale constructions. Factors such 
as soil conditions, equipment used, and depth of the treatment can further affect the costs of vibroflotation.
 <a href="#Paul, 2017">(Paul, 2017)</a>
More environmental factors include noise population and depending on the location/country, they may restrict the 
use of it as it causes to much disturbance to wildlife and the residents. If a building wants to built in the city, they may not have the spacial requirements to use the equipment.

Countries effected by soil liquefaction use another treatment to minimise the risks. The process involves using pile foundations. Pile foundations provides a crucial role 
to a building’s stability especially in challenging circumstances such as having poor soil conditions.  Pile foundations transfer the load from the structure to the deeper
layers of rock and denser soils below the weak soil.  Multiple piles are placed and equally spaced along the surface, so the load of the building distributed along each 
pile evenly. There are multiple of different piles that can be used. One of those are timber piles. For poorer countries like Bangladesh, which also has poor soil stability,
these piles are cheap and easy to get hold of. However, HIC’s like Japan, they can afford other alternatives which have more stability and can last for longer periods of
time in the long run. They can afford concrete and steel piles. These have a greater elastic limit, so they can hold more force without deforming. Challenges are that 
finding strong soil or rock is different in every geological location. On average they put the foundation around 40m below the grounds surface however in other circumstances it requires to be much deeper, which will be much more costly and may not be worth it in the end. Despite timber piles being able to enhance a buildings 
durability, they are still vulnerable to decay overtime from factors such as water and insects. Steel piles are at risk of corrosion. In water saturated conditions, 
the steel piles can corrode over time leading to weaker structural stability for a building.

<p>
In conclusion, understanding the mechanisms of soil liquefaction is crucial to minimise the risk of building damage and irreversible humanitarian harm. In contrasts, to
countries where earthquakes are rare. The soil evaluation process can prove itself to be stricter compared to those nations. As visual evaluation of land is not viable
for earthquake prone areas such as Japan which are at high risks of earthquake liquification. These countries may already consider factors such as ground water levels,
however they may be more lenient since they’re not at risk of earthquake liquefaction. For example, the land in the UK may not be acceptable to build on to Japan’s 
standards. This is why treatments for soil liquefaction are developed to ensure these lands can be built on. The usage of vibroflotation proves itself to be promising,
providing the building with both better land quality and a drainage system to mitigate water pressure in the soil. However, the environmental factors must be considered,
like the disturbance of wildlife due to the noise pollution. Furthermore, the usage of pile foundations both benefits rich countries and poor countries as it has
alternative materials such as timber and steel. But these materials have the risk of decay and corrosion.
