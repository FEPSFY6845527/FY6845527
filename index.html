Modern knowledge and technology enable us to create new buildings which are no longer prone to earthquakes which is important in earthquake prone areas such as Japan and 
Chile. This technological advancement prevents humanitarian and economic casualties if done correctly. As it’ll mitigate injuries and lives lost from collapsing buildings 
and will also prevent the government doing constant maintenance due to this phenomenon. This conference project will discuss what soil liquefaction is and the treatment used
on the soils to mitigate its effects on structures. Soil liquefaction is considered one of the most challenging natural hazards for Civil Engineers.

Visually, it may seem like the land is suitable for building however personal judgement is not always reliable for these scenarios. Personal judgement does not consider
details such as ground water levels, which is crucial to earthquake prone countries like Japan. All soils have a minimum limit of magnitude for of soil liquefaction to
occur, known as the liquefaction potential. There are soil treatment methods which’ll improves the soil quality to ensure land is suitable for construction. It’s said that
on an earthquake with as small as magnitude as 4.5 can cause liquefaction but only for land that’s not even suitable for the lightest of buildings. Furthermore, for land 
suitable for building structures, a minimal magnitude of 5 can cause liquefaction. Therefore, for countries effected by larger magnitudes, they use soil treatment methods to 
increase its liquefaction potential.

Before searching around for solutions, it’s important to understand what soil liquefaction is and why it happens. Soil liquefaction is the process where soil temporarily 
loses it strength and stops its ability to support buildings. It will have a liquid like nature and therefore cause things like buildings to sink. Soil liquidation usually
occur to water saturated soil. During the phenomenon of earthquakes, the space between the soil particles which are filled with water exerts pressure which causes the soil
particles to spread out, hence lowering its density. Once a building is affected by soil liquefaction it is difficult to near impossible to fix the scenario due to its mass.
So, it’s important to come up with a solution before an earthquake hits.

Soil liquefaction is the process where soil temporarily loses it strength and stops its ability to support buildings. It will have a liquid like nature and therefore 
cause things like buildings to sink. Soil liquidation usually occur to water saturated soil. During the phenomenon of earthquakes, the space between the soil particles
which are filled with water exerts pressure which causes the soil particles to spread out, hence lowering its density. Once a building is affected by soil liquefaction 
it is difficult to near impossible to fix the scenario due to its mass. So, it’s important to come up with a solution before an earthquake hits.  

Vibroflotation is a method a soil treatment. It’s a ground improvement technique which enhances the soil quality by densifying loose granular soils.  The process involves
a probe and as its lowered down into the soil, it’ll generate vibrations which reorganised the soil particle’s structure and makes them more compact together. Hence
increasing its density allowing it to both support heavy structures and less prone to soil liquefaction. Other instances to further minimise the risk of soil liquefaction,
they add additional settlement like gravel creating stone columns. Stone columns increases the maximum capacity which land can hold a building. As the stone collum is 
inserted to the land, they displace water that’s already trapped in the soil sediment. Furthermore, the stone column acts as a water pressure evacuation point and mitigates
further risks of soil liquefaction in case an earthquake hit. However, this processdoes also have its drawbacks. For regular housing, vibroflotation is too expensive for
a regular household. It is only suitable for large scale constructions. Factors such as soil conditions, equipment used, and depth of the treatment can further affect the 
costs of vibroflotation. Another issue is the environment, depending on the area, it may not meet the spatial requirements the equipment used. More environmental factors
include noise population and depending on the location/country, they may restrict the use of it as it causes to much disturbance to wildlife and the residents.
